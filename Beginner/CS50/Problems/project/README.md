# My Weather App
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

This project is chalanging journey of creating weather app. I love to cycle, so this app is perfect for fellow cycling enthusiasts. As a compleate beginner in software development, choosing a project was hardest part. I have no prior experiance, the steps and tools required and needed to take seemed confusing and i didnt knew where to begin. As a cyclist i check weather conditions and information constantly so it gave me the idea that i could make a weather app. I had a little knowlage in html + css and had decided to combine python backend and html for front end use.

For this project libraries and other tools i will use:

-Flask
-requests
-python-dotenv
-Open weather API
-Bootstraps
-Ionos cloud hosting

The chosen framework for building the app backend was Flask. I didnt knew how simple or hard or flexible Flask could be for beginners. To retrieve weather data, the OpenWeather API was used, it offers reliable weather information. Additionally, python-dotenv to ensure secure managment for API key by keeping seperate and secure from the main code. Finally, Bootstrap, a CSS framework was chosen to create a clean simple and responsive design for user interface. The final touch will be to deploy the app on ionos cloud hosting service.

Getting started preseted its own chalanges, learning Flask invovled learning templates and how to use and run local server. How to integrate OpenWeather API was an other step in learning development. It involved a lot of googling to fully understand how to pull and display data i needed and planing what can work and how to write code and combine python with html index. And little bit of data reading.

On front end, I decided to use Bootstrap, its popular CSS framework and fairly simple to use and design clean simple, clean and responsive. Wanted the app easy to use on PC-dekstop and mobile device.

The final step will be to deploy the app so its accessible online. I am considering using Ionos cloud hosting for this project tho i am still thinking because since there are costs involved. But online hosting would be new learning curve.

Overall this project for me was great introduction in web development, has thought me how to work with range of tools learned how Flask and APIs works basics of front end development. I am looking foward on my new projects in the future.
