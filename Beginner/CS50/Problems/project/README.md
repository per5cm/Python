# My Weather App
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

The hardest part about this project is picking the project, what you wanna to create. I have never done a software project before and i have no idea where or what to start and what kind of steps you need to take.

So i have decided to make a weather app because i love riding bikes and to be informed about weather is cruicial as cyclist and it could be fun by making your own app.

For this project libraries and other tools i will use are:

-Flask
-requests
-python-dotenv
-Open weather API
-Bootstraps
-Ionos cloud hosting
