# File I/O

So up until now, most every program that we written just stores all the information that it collects in memory that is, in variables or inside of the program itself, a downside of whichis that, as soon as the program exits, anything you typed in.

# list

making a list.

# open

it does just that, but to open programmatically so that you, the programmer, can actually read information from it.

'docs.python.org/3/library/fuctions.html#open'

open returns file handle a special value that allows me to access that file subsequently.

# with

allows you to specify...

# sorted

```python
sorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)
```
'docs.python.org/3library/functions.html#sorted'

# csv 

stands for Comma-Seperated Values
'docs.python.org/3library/csv.html'

its just to store multiple piece of information. its commonly used with excel, apple numbers or google spreadsheets and you want to export the data to share.

# lambda

in python which says: hey, Python, here comes a function, but it has no name. its anonymous.

# wtf is anonymous functions

...
