# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It allows developers to write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale projects. Python is both a program and an interpreter, meaning you can write Python code in a file and execute it, and Python will interpret and run your code.

# Function: 
A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are like actions or verbs that let you perform operations within a program. Python, like many programming languages, comes with a set of built-in functions, such as 'print()', which are predefined actions that the computer already knows how to execute.
```python
# Using a function to display text
print ("hello, world")  # This function outputs text to the console
```
Side Effects: Some functions perform actions that affect the outside world, such as displaying output on the screen or modifying global variables.

# wtf is GUI. - GUI stands for Graphical User Interface

Components: Includes windows, buttons, text boxes, icons, and menus.
Libraries: Python has libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy for building GUIs.
Usage: GUIs make software more accessible to non-technical users by providing intuitive and visually interactive elements.

# Return Values

In programming, a return value is the result that a function produces. When a function completes its task, it can return a value to the part of the program that called it. This value can then be used in further computations or operations.

# Variables - is just a container for some value inside of a computer

A variable is a container for storing data values. In Python, variables are created by assigning a value to a name using the '=' (assignment operator). Variables can store different types of data, such as integers, strings, and lists.
```python
# Variable assignment
x = 10  # x is a variable holding the integer 10
name = "Alice"  # name is a variable holding the string "Alice"
```

# Comments

notes for yourself and computer ignores it.

# Pseudocode

pseudocode isnt a formal thing, its not specific language, its just your own language to express your thoughts succinctly, methodically, algorithmically.

its a to do list.

1. Boil water
2. Add tea bag to cup
3. Pour boiled water into cup
4. Steep tea for 5 minutes
5. Remove tea bag
6. Add milk and sugar as desired
7. Serve tea

# Parameters

named parameters. they are optional (named SEP, seperator, or END for the line ending)

# Strings and F-Strings

F-Strings is a new thing on pythong. It tells Python to format things in special way.

# Integer short for int

interger is a whole number

# Interactive mode

not sure what is is.

# Float

A float is a number that has a decimal point. Floats are used for representing fractional numbers and support decimal arithmetic.
```python
pi = 3.14159  # A float variable
temperature = 98.6
```
# def function - shot for define for creating your own functions

The def keyword in Python is used to define a function. Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. Defining functions helps organize code and make it more modular.

# scope

scope refers to a variable only existing in the context in which you defined it.
