# Libraries

usefull for automation of your task.

the idea to share code saved code from you or others. Re-useability of the code.

Python comes with 'random' library: 'docs.python-org/3/library/random.html'

# Import - keyword

random.choice(seq)

# From - keyword

from is a keyword in Python when you import functions it allows you to be more specific than import alone.

# random.randint(a, b)

it implies get back a random int, it's a random int between A an B inclusive: so if you were to pass in 1 for A and 10 for B.

# random.shuffle(x)

its like randomize them like a deck of cards so to speak.

# statistics 

for data analyzing: 'docs.python.org/3/livrary/statistics.html

# command-line argument

generally tha allow you to provide input not when propted inside of a program as happens whenever we call Python function.

# sys // sys.argv (argument vectors)

is a short word for system, contains a whole lot of functionality that's specific to the system itself and the commands that you typing: 'docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html'

# sys.exit 

as the name suggest its gonna do exactly that. 

# slices

# packages

# PyPi

'pypi.org'

# cowsay

'pypi.org/projects/cowsay'

# pip 

package manager, allows you to install packages

# APIs 

Application programming interface

# requests

# JSON 

JavaScript Object Notation, JSON is sued as tipical language agnostic format for exchanging data between computers.
'docs.python.org/3/library/json.html'

# Style

PEP 8 python enhancment proposal that tried to standardized how code should look rather tried. ' peps-python.org/pep-0008/'

its a style guide to code 'Readability counts', its not a rule but rather a guidelines.

    Indentation
    Tabs or Spaces?
    Maximum Line Lenght
    Blank Lines
    Imports
    etc...

# pylint
